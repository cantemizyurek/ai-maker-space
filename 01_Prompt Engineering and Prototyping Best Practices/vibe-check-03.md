## Question

Write a short, imaginative story (100â€“150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

## Answer

In the bustling city of Technopolis, where robots and humans coexisted, there lived a small, unassuming robot named Pixel. Pixel was designed for simple tasks, often overlooked by the towering, more advanced machines. One day, while tidying up a forgotten corner of the city, Pixel stumbled upon an old, dusty piano in a neglected park.

Curious, Pixel pressed a key, and a soft, melodic note filled the air. Intrigued, Pixel continued to play, each note echoing with a warmth that seemed to awaken the park itself. As the days passed, Pixel returned to the piano, learning to play beautiful melodies.

One evening, a young girl named Lily, drawn by the enchanting music, approached Pixel. She sat beside the robot, her eyes wide with wonder. Together, they played, creating harmonies that danced through the twilight. In that unexpected place, amidst the notes and laughter, Pixel found a friend, and the park blossomed with life once more.
