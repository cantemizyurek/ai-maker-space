## Answer

To get exactly 12 apples, you need to buy packs of 4 apples. Since each pack contains 4 apples, you can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing 12 by 4:

[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 ]

So, you need to buy 3 packs of apples.

For the oranges, each pack contains 3 oranges. To get exactly 9 oranges, divide 9 by 3:

[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 ]

Thus, you need to buy 3 packs of oranges.

In summary, you need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.
